===Kinetic Energy and Impact Force===

Kinetic energy is the energy an object has because of its motion.
A force can cause an object with mass to change its velocity.
Work occurs when a force is applied to move an object a certain distance. Therefore, work is equal to force multiplied by distance: W = F Ã— d. 

Impact Force or a slowing down force, is a force to slowing down an moving object.

Note: To reduce impact force of the car receive, the car's current kinetic energy must be used to do some work to another object, so the kinetic energy is transfered.
It can be achieved by:
* Design a car with long "crumple zone", so more car's kinetic energy will be used to crumple it.
* Design a car with high toughness material, to absorb more kinetic energy and plastically deform without fracturing.
