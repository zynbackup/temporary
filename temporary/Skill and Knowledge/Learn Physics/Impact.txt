===Impact===

* While the car is capable to generate tremendous to accelerate due to mechanical advantage of the gear,
the material of the typical car is not capable to protect the passenger with crash more than 65 km/hour.
The typical car is not capable to absorb the kinetic energy of such high velocity.
The car will deform, and the passenger will be pressed to death.

See video of typical car crash test, the speed of the car is not more than 65 km/hour.
Some automobil car is fail on the crash test 60 km/hour.
Is it not safe inside a car that crash more than 50 km/h, even if it has seatbelt and airbag.
Because the car will deform, and the passenger will be pressed to death.

* When a car crash with wall at speed 64 km/h, and stop after the crash. The energy kinetic of the car is converted to deform the "crumple zone" of the car,
after the material is deform, the vehicle and the passenger is decellerating.
Then the rigid part inside the car (machine) is hit the wall, since the rigid part is hard to deform, the car will experience a sudden stop (the deceleration is high)
The passenger inside is still moving at speed approx. 50 km/h, when the car stop, then the seatbelt will give force to slowdown the passenger speed.
The passenger experience:
- An impact force with the seatbelt.
- a g-force that is cause by a deceleration.

* A G-Force is actually a calculation of acceleration/deceleration, not force.
1 g is an acceleration of 9.8 meters per second per second (m/s^2).
30 g is an acceleration of 30*9.8 = 294 meters per second per second (m/s^2).

* Real life example (A crash test of toyota agya perform by asean ncap)
Toyota agya 2015, 830 kg (750 kg kerb mass + 80 kg passenger) car crash with rigid block at speed 64 km/h and the car collapse 1 meter and stop after the crash.
The driver experience 35 miliseconds of impact with seatbelt (from high speed camera of mini cooper car crash test)

1. What is the impact force of the car?
2. What is the impact force of the passenger and the seat belt?

1. Answer:
Impact force x distance traveled after impact = Kinetic energy of the car
F x D = 0.5 x mass x (velocity squared)
F x 1 meter = 0.5 x 850 kg x (64 km/h squared)
F x 1 meter = 0.5 x 850 kg x (18 m/s squared)
F x 1 = 0.5 x 850 x 324
F = 137700 Newton or 14051 kg !
The impact force, a car experience/generate is 137700 Newton.

Note: 137700 Newton is more than enough to break a human bone.

2. Answer:
I measure the distance between my driving position and the sterring wheel on my car it is only 30 cm (0.3 m).
The area of my seat belt is ?
The width of my seat belt is 4.5 cm (0.045 m), the length of the seat belt attach around my hip is approx 37 cm (0.37 m).
So the area of the seat belt is 0.01665 meter squared.

Impact force x distance traveled after impact = Kinetic energy of passenger.
F x D = 0.5 x mass x (velocity squared)
F x 30 cm = 0.5 x 80 kg x (50 m/s squared)
F x 0.3 meter = 0.5 x 80 kg x (13.889 m/s squared)
F x 0.3 = 0.5 x 80 x 192.9
F x 0.3 = 7716
F = 7716/0.3
F = 25720 Newton or 25720/9.8 = 2624 kg !!

Pressure = Force / Area
Pressure = 25720 Newton / 0.01665 meter squared
Pressure = 1544745 psi !!!

Based on this high force the seatbelt do to the body,
I know that Dr. Logan is right when they say:
“From the seatbelt alone, you tend to get a fracture in most frontal crashes; 
you’ll get a fracture in your right collar bone, if you’re a driver, 
or the left collar bone, if you’re a passenger,” Dr. Logan said.

Note: That's why you should wear the seat belt in a proper position:
AROUND THE PELVIC BONE, not around the stomach, because the pressure is so high when a crash happen,
if ou place the seatbelt around the stomach, your internal organ inside the stomach will be pressed and damaged.



* If the car is constructed with rigid material that is hard to deform, when the car crash, the deceleration of the car would be very fast,
resulting the deceleration of the passenger is very fast too,


* The key to minimize damage to the passenger of the car is to decelerate the passenger slowly, 
with the material that is higher in area, to minimize the pressure to the passenger body while decelerate it.
