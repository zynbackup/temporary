Note: A force is a push or pull upon an object resulting from the object's interaction with another object.
A force can cause an object with mass to change its velocity.

The size of the forces on the FIRST body equals the size of the force on the SECOND body. 
The direction of the force on the first body is opposite to the direction of the force on the second body. 


Example 1 (Person sit on a chair):
When a person sit in the chair, the person's body (first body) exerts a downward force (gravitional force/weight) on the chair (SECOND body). 
The chair exert the same upward reaction force to the person's body.

Example 2 (A man push a car without handbrake applied):
When a man (first body) push a car (second body), the man's body exerts a forward force on the car. 
The car exert same backward reaction force on the man.
The car will move forward because the friction force of the car is lower than the forward force of the man (because handbrake not applied)
The man will not move backward because the friction force of the man's feet and the ground is higher than the reaction force of the car.

Example 3 (A child wearing rollerblade push a car with handbrake applied)
When a child (first body) push a car (second body), the child's body exerts a forward force on the car.
The car exert same backward force on the child.
The child will move backward because the friction force of the child's feet and the ground is lower than the reaction force of the car.
The car will not move forward because the friction force of the car tire and the ground is higher than the forward force of the child.
